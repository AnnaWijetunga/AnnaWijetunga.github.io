It's funny where life takes you.

Ever since the tender age of five, my dream job was to become a teacher. I wanted nothing more than to assign homework and bake cookies for my students.

I'm here to tell you I did indeed become a Kindergarten teacher and do both of those things. 

For a while this was the challenging, and quite often syrupy sweet, job I'd always wanted. 

Until it wasn't.

Even though it felt like I was throwing away a perfectly good career and a degree, off I went.

Health Coach, sold running shoes, personal trainer, and mama.

Each new opportunity had that initial excitement of *new* and *interesting*, followed by a wave of regret for tossing my previous time and efforts.

You may very well guess that becoming a mama changed things for me. Shortly after spending the first year home raising my wee babe, I pursued a radically new (for me!) opportunity because I needed to get out of the house! make friends! speak a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g other than baby talk!

I was hired to work for an ed-tech company in New York City. This, my dear readers, ignited the spark.

Over the next (almost) two years, I learned about shocking things such as

1) the internet
2) what "custom code" meant
3) the magic of HTML and CSS

And there was someone who knew all of this so very well.

He was a Product Specialist. Anything I couldn't "fix" for a customer on my own, he'd immediately offer possible solutions. **Every** time I'd wonder, 

# "How does he know all this?!"

He could fix, update, customize, arrange *anything*. He was outrageously talented.

And that, folks, is why I'm even here.

I'm here on this wild new path to become a Software Engineer in 5 measly months because a very special unicorn showed me what's possible.

I've seen the power of knowing how to speak to a computer, and the good that can come of that. It's extensive, it's incredible, it's the most awe-inspiring thing I've seen in a long while.

So here I am, and if you're reading this, here *we* go! Giddy up and yee-haw, we're in for quite a ride.
